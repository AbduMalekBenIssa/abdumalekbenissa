## Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdu, a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary. I like building things that solve actual problems - whether that's automating repetitive tasks, creating tools for better productivity, or building apps that make life a bit easier.

## What I've been working on

Over the past while, I've worked on a bunch of different projects across different tech stacks. Here's what I've learned along the way:

### Full-stack web development

Built **URide**, a university carpooling platform for a hackathon. The goal was to make it easier for students to find rides and split costs. Used Next.js and TypeScript for the frontend, set up the architecture for Firebase integration (Auth and Firestore), and worked with Google Maps API for route visualization. Added real-time chat functionality, role-based dashboards for drivers/riders, and a community events system. The project taught me a lot about state management, API integration, and building scalable React applications with proper TypeScript typing.

### Browser extensions and productivity tools

Created **FlowGuard**, a Chrome extension to block distracting websites during work hours. Used Chrome's Manifest V3 with the declarativeNetRequest API for efficient blocking. Added scheduling features so you can set specific work hours, categorized blocklists, and a clean UI. All vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks. This one was interesting because working with Chrome's extension APIs is different from regular web dev, especially dealing with service workers and permissions.

### Desktop applications

Built **StockSnap** with a classmate (Omar) as a portfolio management system using JavaFX. Integrated the FinancialModelPrep API for real-time stock data, implemented buy/sell transaction tracking, portfolio analytics, and watchlist features. Added dark mode theming and multiple views (dashboard, market, portfolio, transaction history). Working with Java and JavaFX was a different experience from web development - dealing with FXML layouts, controllers, and desktop UI patterns. The API integration taught me about handling HTTP requests in Java and parsing JSON responses.

### Educational games and interactive experiences

Worked on an **Ethics Education Game** with Emmanuel Amaechi (sustainability researcher at UCalgary). Built an interactive game from scratch using vanilla JavaScript that presents students with ethical dilemmas in academic settings. Each choice affects three metrics: academic standing, peer reputation, and integrity. The branching narrative system tracks decisions and provides personalized feedback. I automated the AI logic pathways using Zapier and MindStudio to analyze player choices. We presented this at a Faculty of Education workshop with 10+ participants.

### Automation and web scraping

Recently built **PFG Shift Scraper** because I was tired of constantly checking my work schedule manually. Used Selenium to automate logging into the TM Portal and scrape schedule data, SQLite to store shift history and detect changes, and set up an email notification system with SMTP. The change detection compares current vs previous schedules and alerts me when something changes. Set it up to run automatically every few hours with Windows Task Scheduler. This project was all about making life easier through automation.

## Technologies I've worked with

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, HTML/CSS

**Web frameworks:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS

**Backend/Database:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore), SQLite, REST APIs

**Desktop:** JavaFX, Maven

**Automation:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup, web scraping, scheduled tasks

**Tools:** Git, Chrome Extension APIs, Google Maps API, various third-party APIs

**Other:** Responsive design, state management, authentication flows, data persistence, real-time features

## What I'm interested in

I like projects that solve real problems or automate annoying tasks. Web scraping is interesting because you can extract useful data from websites that don't have APIs. Building full-stack apps teaches you about how everything connects - frontend, backend, database, APIs. Desktop applications are a different challenge from web apps. And automation projects are satisfying because they save you time every day after you build them once.

Currently exploring more automation possibilities and ways to integrate AI into practical applications.
